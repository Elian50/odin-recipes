# odin-recipes
<!-- In this project I will work on creating a basic recipe website where I'll talk about
my favorite recipes.
By the end of this project, I should be able to demonstrate that I know how to use HTML's most basic functions, such as attributes and basic boilerplate coding.
I should also be able to add images, make lists, redirect to different websites and/or links within my project and more! -->
