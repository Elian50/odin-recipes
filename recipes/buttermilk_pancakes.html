        the outside.</p>

    <p>This recipe keeps it simple and reliable. Serve them stacked high with butter, maple
        syrup, fruit, or your favorite toppings. They're perfect for a cozy weekend breakfast
        or a special brunch.This recipe keeps it simple and reliable. Serve them stacked high

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
           
            <li><strong>Boil the potatoes</strong></li> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold, 
                        salted water.</li>
                    <li>Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender
                        (about 15 to 20 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Drain and let them cool slightly on a clean towel or
                        baking tray.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Preheat and prepare</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
                    <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly oil it.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, mix the olive oil with minced garlic.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Smash the potatoes</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the boiled potatoes on the baking sheet, spaced
                        slightly apart.</li>
                    <li>Use the bottom of a glass, jar, or potato masher to
                        gently press each one down until about ½ inch thick.</li>
                    <li>Be careful not to break them apart completely, 
                        they should hold together with cracked edges.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Season and roast</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Brush each smashed potato with the garlic olive oil 
                        mixture.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and optional toppings like 
                        parmesan or chili flakes.</li>
                    <li>Roast in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the edges 
                        are golden and crispy.</li>
                </ul>


            <li><strong>Garnish and serve</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove from the oven and let rest briefly.</li>
                <li>Finish with chopped fresh herbs and a little lemon juice 
                    if desired.</li>
                <li>Serve warm with a dipping sauce or alongside your main dish.</li>
            </ul>

        </ol>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Let the potatoes dry completely before smashing, this helps them 
            crisp up better in the oven.</li>
        <li>For extra crispiness, broil the potatoes for the last 2 to 3 
            minutes of roasting (just keep a close eye on them!).</li>
    </ul>
