        the outside.</p>

        syrup, fruit, or your favorite toppings. They're perfect for a cozy weekend breakfast

        <ol>
           
            <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients</strong></li> 
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar,
                        baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                    <li>Make a well in the center to prepare for the wet ingredients.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Mix wet ingredients</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a separate bowl or measuring jug, whisk together
                        the buttermilk, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla
                        extract (if using).</li>
                    <li>Stir until fully combined.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Combine wet and dry</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the well of the dry ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Gently mix until just combined, some small lumps are okay.</li>
                    <li>Do not overmix, or the pancakes may become tough.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Cook the pancakes</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat a nonstick skillet or griddle over medium
                        heat and lightly grease with butter or oil.</li>
                    <li>Pour ¼ cup of batter per pancake onto the hot surface.</li>
                    <li>Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges
                        start to look set (about 2 to 3 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Flip and cook another 1 to 2 minutes, until golden brown
                        and cooked through.</li>
                </ul>


            <li><strong>Serve</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Serve hot with your favorite toppings: classic butter
                    and maple syrup, or get creative with fresh fruit, whipped cream,
                    or chocolate chips.</li>
            </ul>

        </ol>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Let the batter rest for 5 to 10 minutes before cooking to allow the flour
            to hydrate and the baking soda to activate, this leads to fluffier pancakes.</li>
        <li>Keep pancakes warm in a 200°F (90°C) oven while cooking the rest,
            so they're all hot and ready to serve together.</li>
    </ul>
