    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Smashed potatoes are crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and incredibly
        satisfying. They're made by boiling small potatoes until tender, gently smashing 
        them, then roasting until golden and crisp. Perfect as a side dish or appetizer,
        they're easy to customize with garlic, herbs, cheese, or whatever toppings you 
        love.</p>

    <p>This version keeps it simple and flavorful, using olive oil, garlic, and fresh
        herbs to complement the natural richness of the potatoes. You can serve them with
        a dipping sauce like sour cream, aioli, or just eat them straight off the tray,
        they're that good.</p>
   
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
           
            <li><strong>Boil the potatoes</strong></li> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold, 
                        salted water.</li>
                    <li>Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender
                        (about 15 to 20 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Drain and let them cool slightly on a clean towel or
                        baking tray.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Preheat and prepare</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
                    <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly oil it.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, mix the olive oil with minced garlic.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Smash the potatoes</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the boiled potatoes on the baking sheet, spaced
                        slightly apart.</li>
                    <li>Use the bottom of a glass, jar, or potato masher to
                        gently press each one down until about ½ inch thick.</li>
                    <li>Be careful not to break them apart completely, 
                        they should hold together with cracked edges.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Season and roast</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Brush each smashed potato with the garlic olive oil 
                        mixture.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and optional toppings like 
                        parmesan or chili flakes.</li>
                    <li>Roast in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the edges 
                        are golden and crispy.</li>
                </ul>


            <li><strong>Garnish and serve</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove from the oven and let rest briefly.</li>
                <li>Finish with chopped fresh herbs and a little lemon juice 
                    if desired.</li>
                <li>Serve warm with a dipping sauce or alongside your main dish.</li>
            </ul>

        </ol>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Let the potatoes dry completely before smashing, this helps them 
            crisp up better in the oven.</li>
        <li>For extra crispiness, broil the potatoes for the last 2 to 3 
            minutes of roasting (just keep a close eye on them!).</li>
    </ul>
